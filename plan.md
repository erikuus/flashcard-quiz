# Flashcard Quiz Plan

- [x] Generate a Phoenix LiveView project called `flashcard_quiz`
- [ ] Start the server so you can view the app as we build it
- [ ] Replace `home.html.heex` with a static mockup of our planned design
- [ ] Create migration for flashcards table with front/back text fields
- [ ] Implement the Flashcards context module with CRUD operations:
  - create_flashcard/1 - creates a new flashcard
  - list_flashcards/0 - lists all flashcards  
  - get_flashcard!/1 - gets a single flashcard
  - update_flashcard/2 - updates a flashcard
  - delete_flashcard/1 - deletes a flashcard
- [ ] Create QuizLive LiveView with the following features:
  - Quiz state management (current card, score, total cards)
  - Card flipping animations with CSS transitions
  - Progress tracking through the deck
  - Real-time score updates via PubSub
  - Navigation between cards (next/previous)
- [ ] Create QuizLive template with minimalist study focus design:
  - Clean card display with front/back content
  - Flip button with smooth transitions
  - Progress indicator
  - Score display
  - Wrap content in `<Layouts.app flash={@flash}>...</Layouts.app>`
- [ ] Create ManageLive LiveView for flashcard management:
  - Form for creating/editing flashcards
  - List view of existing flashcards
  - Edit/delete actions for each card
- [ ] Create ManageLive template with management interface
- [ ] Update layouts to match minimalist study focus design:
  - Force light theme in `root.html.heex`
  - Remove theme switcher from `<Layouts.app>`
  - Update `app.css` with calming, focused color scheme
- [ ] Update router with new routes:
  - Remove placeholder home route `get "/"`
  - Add quiz route as new root: `live "/", QuizLive`
  - Add management route: `live "/manage", ManageLive`
- [ ] Visit the app with `web` to verify everything is working
